# Talecto — AI recruiting platform

Talecto helps hiring teams find the best candidates faster by scoring applicants based on skills, experience, potential and cultural fit — not just keywords. This repository contains demo material and documentation about AI-driven candidate ranking and screening approaches.

## Why Talecto?
Many applicants are missed by simple keyword filters. Talecto's AI analyzes profiles holistically to surface qualified candidates who might otherwise be overlooked. Learn more and try the platform at **[Talecto — AI recruiting platform](https://talecto.com)**.
